## Contact Us

We do not have a public/community discord server at this time, as we only intend to create one when we get closer to the launch date. If for some reason
you feel the need to contact us, you can join our private [development discord server](https://discord.gg/WctRV3MVp8). **You will be kicked if you do not have a
good reason to stay.**
